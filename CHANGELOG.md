# Changelog
## 1.55.1
* Enhancement - Third party dependency version updates [#2982](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/pull/2982) [#2983](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/pull/2983)

## 1.55.0
* Feature - Support buffer limit option in FireLens [#2958](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/pull/2958)
* Enhancement - Introduce optional jitter for task cleanup wait duration, configurable via `ECS_ENGINE_TASK_CLEANUP_WAIT_DURATION_JITTER` environment variable. In use case where there are large number of tasks being stopped at the same time, specifying this jitter can help avoid all the task cleanup happening at the same time (the latter could add pressure to the instance and as a result affect running tasks) [#2969](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/pull/2969)

## 1.54.1

## 1.40.0
* Enhancement - Agent's default stats gathering is changing from docker streaming stats to polling. This should not affect the metrics that customers ultimately see in cloudwatch, but it does affect how the agent gathers the underlying metrics from docker. This change was made for considerable performance gains. Customers with high CPU loads may see their cluster utilization increase; this is a good thing because it means the containers are utilizing more of the cluster, and agent/dockerd/containerd are utilizing less [#2452](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/pull/2452)
