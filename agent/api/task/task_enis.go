// both a list of ENI objects into the TaskENIs type (the new scheme) or
// a single ENI object into the TaskENIs type (the old scheme before this object
// was introduced).

// The 'task' package is deemed to be a better home for this than the 'eni' package
// since this is only required for unmarshaling 'Task' object. None of the
// functionality/types in the 'eni' package themselves have any dependencies on this
