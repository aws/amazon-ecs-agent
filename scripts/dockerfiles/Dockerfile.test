# A Dockerfile to run all the the Amazon EC2 Container Service's Container
# Agent's tests.

# Because the Agent's tests include starting docker containers, it is necessary
# to have both go and docker available in the testing environment.
# It's easier to get go, so start with docker-in-docker and add go on top
