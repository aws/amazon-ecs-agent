# Amazon ECS Container Agent

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aws/amazon-ecs-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aws/amazon-ecs-agent)

The Amazon ECS Container Agent is software developed for Amazon EC2 Container Service ([Amazon ECS](http://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)).

It runs on container instances and starts containers on behalf of Amazon ECS.

## Usage

The best source of information on running this software is the [Amazon ECS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_agent.html).

### On the Amazon Linux AMI

On the [Amazon Linux AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/), we provide an init package which can be used via `sudo yum install ecs-init && sudo start ecs`. This is the recommended way to run it in this environment.

### On Other AMIs

The Amazon ECS Container Agent may also be run in a Docker container on an EC2 instance with a recent Docker version installed. A Docker image is available in our [Docker Hub Repository](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/amazon/amazon-ecs-agent/).

```bash
$ mkdir -p /var/log/ecs /etc/ecs /var/lib/ecs/data
$ touch /etc/ecs/ecs.config
$ docker run --name ecs-agent \
    --restart on-failure:10 -d \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /var/log/ecs:/log \
    -v /var/lib/ecs/data:/data \
    -v /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker \
    -p 127.0.0.1:51678:51678 \
    --env-file /etc/ecs/ecs.config \
    -e ECS_LOGFILE=/log/ecs-agent.log \
    -e ECS_DATADIR=/data/ \
    amazon/amazon-ecs-agent
```

See also the Advanced Usage section below.

## Building and Running from Source

**Running the Amazon ECS Container Agent outside of Amazon EC2 is not supported.**

### Docker Image

The Amazon ECS Container Agent may be built by typing `make` with the [Docker
daemon](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) (v1.5.0) running.

This produces an image tagged `amazon/ecs-container-agent:make` that
you may run as described above.

### Standalone

The Amazon ECS Container Agent may also be run outside of a Docker container as a
go binary. This is not recommended for production, but it can be useful for
development or easier integration with your local Go tools.

The following commands run the agent outside of Docker:

```
make gobuild
./out/amazon-ecs-agent
```

### Make Targets

The following targets are available. Each may be run with `make <target>`.

| Make Target      | Description |
|:-----------------|:------------|
| `release`        | *(Default)* Builds the agent within a Docker container and and packages it into a scratch-based image |
| `gobuild`        | Runs a normal `go build` of the agent and stores the binary in `./out/amazon-ecs-agent` |
| `static`         | Runs `go build` to produce a static binary in `./out/amazon-ecs-agent` |
| `test`           | Runs all tests using `go test` |
| `test-in-docker` | Runs all tests inside a Docker container |
| `clean`          | Removes build artifacts. *Note: this does not remove Docker images* |

## Advanced Usage

The Amazon ECS Container Agent supports a number of configuration options, most of
which should be set through environment variables.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are available. All of them are optional.
They are listed in a general order of likelihood that a user may want to
configure them as something other than the defaults.

| Environment Key | Example Value(s)            | Description | Default Value |

| `ECS_RESERVED_PORTS_UDP` | `[53, 123]` | An array of UDP ports that should be marked as unavailable for scheduling on this container instance. | `[]` |
| `ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE`     |  "docker" &#124; "dockercfg" | The type of auth data that is stored in the `ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA` key. | |
| `ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA`     | See the [dockerauth documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/agent/engine/dockerauth) | Docker [auth data](https://godoc.org/github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/agent/engine/dockerauth) formatted as defined by `ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE`. | |
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | &lt;us-west-2&gt;&#124;&lt;us-east-1&gt;&#124;&hellip; | The region to be used in API requests as well as to infer the correct backend host. | Taken from Amazon EC2 instance metadata. |

| `ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT` | 10m | Time to wait for the container to exit normally before being forcibly killed. | 30s |

### Persistence

When you run the Amazon ECS Container Agent in production, its `datadir` should be persisted
between runs of the Docker container. If this data is not persisted, the agent registers
a new container instance ARN on each launch and is not able to update the state of tasks it previously ran.

### Flags

The agent also supports the following flags:

* `-k` &mdash; The agent will not require valid SSL certificates for the services that it communicates with.
* ` -loglevel` &mdash; Options: `[<crit>|<error>|<warn>|<info>|<debug>]`. The
agent will output on stdout at the given level. This is overridden by the
`ECS_LOGLEVEL` environment variable, if present.
